<h2><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>A MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST, AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the
dim-lighted building,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid
down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to death
(he is shot in the abdomen),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stanch the blood temporarily (the youngster's face is white as a lily),<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, some of them
dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the odour of
blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death-spasm
sweating,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hear outside the orders given, <i>Fall in, my men, fall in</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unknown road still marching.</span>

sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Passionately seen and yearn'd for by one poor little child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While others remain busy or smartly talking, forever teaching thrift,
thrift);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O you up there! O pennant! where you undulate like a snake hissing so curious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of reach, an idea only, yet furiously fought for, risking bloody death,
loved by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So loved&mdash;O you banner leading the day with stars brought from the night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding all&mdash;(absolute owner of
all)&mdash;O banner and pennant!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I too leave the rest!&mdash;great as it is, it is nothing&mdash;houses, machines are
nothing&mdash;I see them not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see but you, O warlike pennant! O banner so broad, with stripes, I sing you only,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm is lull'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam ends, and
the cutting away of masts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashion'd houses and barns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The remember'd print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men,
families, goods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it, the outset
anywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddle-bags;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of wood-boys and wood-men with their clear untrimm'd faces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless
impatience of restraint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the
solidification;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and
sloops, the raftsman, the pioneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of snow on
the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glad clear sound of one's own voice, the merry song, the natural life
of the woods, the strong day's work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of
hemlock-boughs, and the bear-skin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house-builder at work in cities or anywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,<br /></span>

regular,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as they were
prepared,<br /></span>

limbs,<br /></span>

and braces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hook'd arm over the plate, the other arm wieldingthe axe,<br /></span>

bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a cross-beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands rapidly
laying the long side-wall, two hundred feet from front to rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels
striking the bricks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bricks one after another each laid so workman-like in its place, and
set with a knock of the trowel-handle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the steady
replenishing by the hod-men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row of well-grown apprentices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swing of their axes on the square-hew'd log shaping it toward the shape
of a mast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butter-colour'd chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats, stays
against the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city fireman, the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close-pack'd
square,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong command through the fire-trumpets, the falling in line, the
rise and fall of the arms forcing the water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slender, spasmic, blue-white jets, the bringing to bear of the hooks
and ladders and their execution,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crash and cut away of connecting wood-work, or through floors if the
fire smoulders under them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd with their lit faces watching, the glare and dense shadows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forger at his forge-furnace and the user of iron after him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the edge with
his thumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one who clean-shapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The death-howl, the limpsy tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe
thither,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The siege of revolted lieges determin'd for liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce and
parley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sack of an old city in its time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe
of brigands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of personality just or unjust.</span></div></div>

<span class="i0">All characters, movements, growths, a few noticed, myriads unnoticed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On interior rivers by night in the glare of pine knots, steamboats wooding
up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the valleys of the
Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys of the Roanoke and
Delaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks the hills,
or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake lost from the flock, sitting on the water
rocking silently,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In farmers' barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labour done, they rest
standing, they are too tired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar on arctic ice the she-walrus lying drowsily while her cubs play
around,<br /></span>

ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest dashes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On solid land what is done in cities as the bells strike midnight together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl of the wolf,
the scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the elk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, in summer visible
through the clear waters, the great trout swimming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas the large black buzzard
floating slowly high beyond the tree tops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, the red cedar festoon'd with tylandria, the pines and cypresses
growing out of the white sand that spreads far and flat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing plants, parasites with
colour'd flowers and berries enveloping huge trees,<br /></span>

troughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees, the
flames with the black smoke from the pitch-pine curling and rising;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Southern fishermen fishing, the sounds and inlets of North Carolina's
coast, the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery, the large
sweep-seines, the windlasses on shore work'd by horses, the clearing,
curing, and packing-houses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the forest in piney woods turpentine dropping from the incisions in
the trees, there are the turpentine works,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are the negroes at work in good health, the ground in all directions
is cover'd with pine straw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Tennessee and Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the forge, by the
furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long absence, joyfully
welcom'd and kiss'd by the aged mulatto nurse,<br /></span>

of high banks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or fiddle, others
sit on the gunwale smoking and talking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing in the
Great Dismal Swamp,<br /></span>

cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree;<br /></span>

returning home at evening, the musket-muzzles all bear bunches of
flowers presented by women;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Mississippi, he
ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">California life, the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude costume, the
stanch California friendship, the sweet air, the graves one in
passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving mules or
oxen before rude carts, cotton bales piled on banks and wharves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul, with equal

running,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I with parties of
snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and aquatic plants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the crow
with its bill, for amusement&mdash;and I triumphantly twittering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh
themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels outside move
around with erect heads watching, and are from time to time reliev'd
by other sentinels&mdash;and I feeding and taking turns with the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters, rising
desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his fore-feet, the
hoofs as sharp as knives&mdash;and I, plunging at the hunters, corner'd
and desperate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the
countless workmen working in the shops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof&mdash;and no less in myself than
the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands&mdash;my body no more inevitable
united, part to part, and made out of a thousand diverse
contributions one identity, any more than my lands are inevitably
united and made <span class="smcap">One identity;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cities, labours, death, animals, products, war, good
and evil&mdash;these me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me and to
America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the union of them,
to afford the like to you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you also be
eligible as I am?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect bouquets
of the incomparable feuillage of these States?</span>

serve other parturitions and transitions,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rise O days from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier, fiercer sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long for my soul hungering gymnastic I devour'd what the earth gave me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long I roam'd the woods of the north, long I watch'd Niagara pouring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I travel'd the prairies over and slept on their breast, I cross'd the
Nevadas, I cross'd the plateaus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail'd out to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high, curling over.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the wind piping; I saw the black clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw from below what arose and mounted (O superb! O wild as my heart, and
powerful!),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast amid
the din they chased each other across the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, and such as these, I, elate, saw&mdash;saw with wonder, yet pensive and
masterful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.</span></div></div>

<span class="i0">'Twas well, O soul&mdash;'twas a good preparation you gave me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something for us is pouring now more than Niagara pouring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torrents of men (sources and rills of the Northwest are you indeed
inexhaustible?),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, to pavements and homesteads here, what were those storms of the
mountains and sea?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front&mdash;Cincinnati, Chicago,
unchain'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How it climbs with daring feet and hands&mdash;how it dashes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the true thunder bellows after the lightning&mdash;how bright the flashes
of lightning!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through the
dark by those flashes of lightning!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a lull of the deafening confusion.)</span></div></div>

<span class="i0">Thunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do you rise higher than ever yet O days, O cities!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crash heavier, heavier yet O storms! you have done me good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long had I walk'd my cities, my country roads through farms, only half
satisfied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One doubt nauseous undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground before
me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing
low;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cities I loved so well I abandon'd and left, I sped to the certainties
suitable to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies and Nature's
dauntlessness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I waited the bursting forth of the pent fire&mdash;on the water and air I waited
long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now I no longer wait, I am fully satisfied, I am glutted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have witness'd the true lightning, I have witness'd my cities electric,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike America rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the mountains roam or sail the stormy sea.</span></div></div>
